What I learned: 

* Functions are really "storage" containers for whatever is returned. What's useful is the return value. Meaning the function's name, it being declared, an expression, or an arrow function, doesn't matter much, but what is returned. 

* As such, the function `playRound()` doesn't need parameters to be useful. Why? Again, because functions are store the useful bits: the return value. 

Places where I can improve:

* The loop itself and its cases look messy and too long. I can shorten it.
