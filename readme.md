## Still not done completely but the essence of the project is. Just need to add a way to :

* start the game without typing the function on the console
* refactor the code, it's messy and too cluttered
* tidy up the styling 
* add documentation regarding my thoughts, thankfully I made notes while working on this

But for now I got to move on with the curriculum!

What I learned: 

* Functions are really "storage" containers for whatever is returned. What's useful is the return value. Meaning the function's name, it being declared, an expression, or an arrow function, doesn't matter much, but what is returned. 

* As such, the function `playRound()` doesn't need parameters to be useful. Why? Again, because functions are store the useful bits: the return value. 

Places where I can improve:

* The loop itself and its cases look messy and too long. I can shorten it.
